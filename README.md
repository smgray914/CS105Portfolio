We were tasked to create a personality quiz, and I am a big fan of Marvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. right now, so I decided to make it based on those characters. I used the Python coding language in online GDB to create this.
Challenges I faced:
It took a long time to figure out how to make the quiz itself work, and get the program to give users a correct response based on their answers. For the most part, I did it completely by myself. In class, we discussed a few very helpful concepts that helped me complete the project.
Result:
I definitely achieved my goals, although I would prefer to have better and deeper questions for the quiz. I think some are very surface-level.

Summary:
Write a 25 to 35 word summary for this project.
