#### GDB- Marvel Personality Quiz
[<img width="1066" height="704" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 10 30 56 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435459a3-f207-4114-92be-18545303acc6" />](https://onlinegdb.com/2gF4rPxft0)

We were tasked to create a personality quiz, and I am a big fan of Marvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. right now, so I decided to make it based on those characters. I used the Python coding language in online GDB to create this.
Challenges I faced:
It took a long time to figure out how to make the quiz itself work, and get the program to give users a correct response based on their answers. For the most part, I did it completely by myself. In class, we discussed a few very helpful concepts that helped me complete the project.
Result:
I definitely achieved my goals, although I would prefer to have better and deeper questions for the quiz. I think some are very surface-level.

Summary:
When entering the quiz, users are given instructions to read each question and answer according to specific parameters. Using the answers they enter, the program figures out which character their answers align most closely with. 

#### Course Grade Evaluator

Initial project idea: 
This project was made to calculate weighted course grades. Users entered assignment grades and section weights; the program gave back your final grade and GPA. To create this code, I used online GDB.

Challenges I faced:
When creating this, I faced little technical challeng. This assignment solidified my understanding of Python, and was more focused on combining aspects learned in class.

Other Resources: 
The resources I used most for this project were the online guides to math in Python, including the videos found on the class Moodle. 

Result:
The results of this assignment were successful. This program helped me keep track of my course grades throughout the semester.

Summary:
This program requires the user to input their name, class code, and list assignment grades and weights. The program then returns a transcript-like report of final grades.

#### [Excel Inventory Manager](https://studentsloyola-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/smgray_loyola_edu/IQAUHS-4fpn7T65rwqyehbkyAYLa6BuIkoq0ArJq-kuoc2I?e=Q3r9HS)

Initial project idea: 
This project aimed to create an inventory manager for a company of my choice and create charts based on sales.

Tools I used: 
This project was created with Excel. This assignment was intended to gain familiarity with Excel and how to navigate Microsoft programs.

Challenges I faced:
The only challenge I faced in creating this was creating a company and inventory information to fill out mock spreadsheets. 

Other Resources: 
In order to get accurate pricing, I used gem sales sites to get bulk pricing, as well as jewelry sites to accurately understand market pricing. 

Result:
This project was useful in understanding how to create formulas in Excel. This could be used by a small business, or with some tweaking, a large company, to accurately price items and track sales. 

Summary:
This assignment can be used to organize inventory and manage budget. Users need to input information like item name, type, manufacturing price, and profit margin, and can track sales and costs.
