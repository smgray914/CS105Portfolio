#### GDB- Marvel Personality Quiz
[<img width="1066" height="704" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 at 10 30 56 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/435459a3-f207-4114-92be-18545303acc6" />](https://onlinegdb.com/2gF4rPxft0)

We were tasked to create a personality quiz, and I am a big fan of Marvel: Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. right now, so I decided to make it based on those characters. I used the Python coding language in online GDB to create this.
Challenges I faced:
It took a long time to figure out how to make the quiz itself work, and get the program to give users a correct response based on their answers. For the most part, I did it completely by myself. In class, we discussed a few very helpful concepts that helped me complete the project.
Result:
I definitely achieved my goals, although I would prefer to have better and deeper questions for the quiz. I think some are very surface-level.

Summary:
When entering the quiz, users are given instructions to read each question and answer according to specific parameters. Using the answers they enter, the program figures out which character their answers align most closely with.
